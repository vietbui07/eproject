                <h2><b>The Nobel Prize</b></h2>
                
                <p><b>Why is there a Nobel Prize?</b></p>
                
                <p>The Nobel Prize was set up whenbusinessman and entrepreneur Alfred Nobel died and left the majority of his fortune to the establishment of prizes in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and peace. His will stated that the prizes should be awarded to “those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind.” </p>
                <p><b>Who was Alfred Nobel?</b></p>
                
                <p>Alfred Nobel was an inventor, entrepreneur, scientist and businessman who also wrote poetry and drama. His varied interests are reflected in the Nobel Prizes which he laid the foundation for in 1895 in his last will and testament. </p>
                <p><b>How long have you been awarding Nobel Prizes?</b></p>
                
                <p>The first Nobel Prizes were awarded in 1901 and they have been awarded annually since then. There have been years in that time when the Nobel Prizes have not been awarded - mostly during World War I (1914-1918) and II (1939-1945). </p>
                <p><b>What are the Nobel Prize categories?</b></p>
                
                <p>The Nobel Prize categories are physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and peace – these were laid out in the will of Alfred Nobel. In 1968, Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden’s central bank) established the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. </p>
                <p><b> Why isn’t there a Nobel Prize in mathematics, engineering, biology or environmental science?</b></p>
                
                <p>The Nobel Prizes were designated in the will of Alfred Nobel and are in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and peace. The economics prize was established much later and is a memorial prize, as indicated by its full name: the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. Its addition was an exception, to celebrate the tercentenary of Sweden’s central bank in 1968.</p>
                <p><b>Why is the Nobel Peace Prize awarded in Norway?</b></p>
                
                <p>In his will Alfred Nobel laid out who he wanted to be responsible for the selection of the Nobel Prize laureates. The prizes were to be awarded by Swedish institutions – apart from the peace prize, whose award was to be decided by a committee of five persons elected by the Norwegian Parliament.</p>
                <p>During Nobel’s lifetime Sweden and Norway were joined in a union but we still don’t know exactly why Alfred Nobel chose for the peace prize to be awarded in Norway. However as the prize committee is located in Oslo, it follows that the prize is also awarded there.</p>
                <p><b>Where does the prize money come from?</b></p>
                
                <p>When Alfred Nobel died leaving the majority of his fortune to the establishment of the Nobel Prize he stated that the money should be converted into a fund and invested in “safe securities.” Today the interest earned on that money is used to fund the Nobel Prizes. </p>
                <p><b>Is it possible to revoke a Nobel Prize?</b></p>
                
                <p>No. Neither Alfred Nobel’s will nor the statutes of the Nobel Foundation mention any such possibility.</p>
                <h2><b>Nobel Prize laureates</b></h2>
                
                <p><b>Why are they called Nobel Prize laureates?</b></p>
                
                <p>The word “laureate” refers to being signified by the laurel wreath. In ancient Greece, laurel wreaths were awarded to victors as a sign of honour. Put that together with the Nobel Prize and we get “Nobel Prize laureate”. </p>
                <p><b>How many people can share the same Nobel Prize?</b></p>
                
                <p>A Nobel Prize can be shared by up to three individuals, or in the case of the peace prize, it can also be awarded to an organisation. The rule that a prize can only be awarded to three people comes from the statutes of the Nobel Foundation, which is responsible for fulfilling the intentions of Nobel’s will. It specifically states: “In no case may a prize amount be divided between more than three persons.”</p>
                <p><b>Can you award a prize posthumously?</b></p>
                
                <p>No, a Nobel Prize cannot be awarded posthumously.</p>
                <p>However, since 1974, if the recipient dies after the prize has been announced they can still be awarded it. Previously, a person could be awarded a prize posthumously if they had already been nominated before 1 February of the same year, which was true of Erik Axel Karlfeldt (Nobel Prize in Literature 1931) and Dag Hammarskjöld (Nobel Peace Prize, 1961).</p>
                <p>Following the 2011 announcement of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, it was discovered that one of the medicine laureates, Ralph Steinman, had passed away three days earlier. The Board of the Nobel Foundation examined the statutes, and came to the conclusion that Ralph Steinman should continue to remain a Nobel Prize laureate, as the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet had announced the 2011 Nobel Prize laureates in physiology or medicine without knowing of his death. </p>
                <p><b>Can someone affiliated with an organisation (like the EU or the IPCC) which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize claim to have received the honour?</b></p>
                
                <p>When an organisation is awarded the Nobel Peace Prize the organisation becomes the laureate, not the individuals working there. Therefore those people connected to or working for a Nobel Prize awarded organisation cannot in any way refer to themselves personally as a Nobel Prize laureate.</p>
                <p><b> How can I contact a Nobel Prize laureate?</b></p>
                
                <p>The Nobel Foundation does not disclose addresses to Nobel Prize laureates out of courtesy. Please contact the institution, organisation or university to which the Nobel Prize laureate was affiliated at the time of the award. For literature laureates please contact their publishing house. Alternatively you may be able to contact some laureates via social media.</p>
