                <h1 class="testh1 heading">Nobel Prize Inspiration Initiative</h1>
                <p>The Nobel Prize Inspiration Initiative (NPII) is a global programme designed to help Nobel Laureates share their inspirational stories and insights. By taking Nobel Prize laureates on visits to universities and research centres around the world, and by capturing their thoughts on video, the initiative seeks to bring the laureates into closer contact with the worldwide scientific community, and especially with an audience of young scientists.</p>
                <p>There have been 34 NPIIs on four continents delivered in partnership with AstraZeneca, a relationship which began in 2010, and two NPIIs delivered in partnership with 3M.</p>
                <p>The event aims to stimulate discussion at the highest level on a topical science-related theme by bringing together Nobel Prize laureates, the world’s leading scientists and experts, key opinion leaders, policy makers and the general public, online as well as on site. By bridging science and society, it’s an opportunity to stimulate thinking, excite imagination and inspire greatness.</p>
