                <h4>A global dialogue on disinformation and the erosion of public understanding and trust in science.</h4>
                <p>Our first Nobel Prize Summit brought together more than 25,000 people from 200 countries to explore how we can secure a sustainable planet. Now we’re asking a new question: how can we build trust in truth, facts and scientific evidence to create a more hopeful future for all?</p>
                <p>We live in a world of interconnected crises: emerging pandemics and health emergencies, post-pandemic disruptions, inflationary and monetary pressures, war, climate change, and increased stresses on society and the environment. But the volume, velocity and reach of misinformation and disinformation in today’s world are weakening public deliberation, and undermining trust in scientists, the institutions and governments they serve, and in democracy itself.</p>
                <p>To help build a more peaceful, prosperous, resilient, and sustainable future informed by science and evidence, the Nobel Foundation and the U.S. National Academy of Sciences are once again joining forces to present the second Nobel Prize Summit: Truth, Trust and Hope.</p>
